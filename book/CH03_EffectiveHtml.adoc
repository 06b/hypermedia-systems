== Why relearn HTML?

The way most of us write HTML is iterative: we write something, _Alt-Tab_ to the browser to see if it works, and go back to edit. The fact that we can do this is one of the best things about web development --- being able to immediately see the system as end users will makes development faster, increases developer happiness and encourages a focus on UX.

This workflow has one unfortunate side effect: Our development becomes driven by our own usage, and any other use of a website becomes an afterthought:

 - Pages are bloated with `<div>` soup, and stylesheets are big as a result of trying to select elements in that mess. The result is slow loading times. footnote:[https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2020/markup[]. Other than `<div>` being the most common element, the HTTP Archive pass:[<cite>Web Almanac</cite>] found that 0.06% of pages surveyed in 2020 contained the nonexistent `<h7>` element. 0.0015% for `<h8>`.]
 - Websites, including websites containing public data or results of publicly-funded research, are impossible to scrape programmatically.
 - So-called MVPs (minimum viable product) are released in open beta while being completely unusable by vast swathes of people -- UX not just buggy, but nonexistent footnote:[https://adrianroselli.com/2022/11/accessibility-gaps-in-mvps.html]. Is an inaccessible product "viable"?
 - Search engines have a harder time extracting useful information from a page, and rank that page lower as a result. 


If you care about machine readability, or human readability, or page weight, what you should do is test. Did you think I was going to talk about semantic HTML? Keep reading for that, but alas, there is no substitute for testing. Test manually. Test automatically. Test with screenreaders, test with a keyboard, test on different browsers and hardware, run linters (while coding and/or in CI). Read the markup -- the markup being sent to browsers, not the templates and code you write. Know exactiy what any type of hypermedia client is doing in any circumstance.

So where does HTML and the s-word come in?

Writing good, spec-compliant HTML lets browsers do a bunch of work for you. When they don't, it makes it easier to write scripts that do. As a result, fewer issues will be found during this testing and you can release faster. When issues do come up, you can often fix them more easily by rewritlng semantic HTML as opposed to heaping JavaScript and ARIA attributes on top of everything.

Good HTML will not absolve you from doing your job, but it will make it easier.


== A note on the S-word

Semantics is standardization.

In human language, a word can only mean something if some group of people know it to mean that thing. You could define your own words and use them (mathematicians really like to) but it's difficult. Not only will you need to provide a definition each time you use it, but you also need an audience interested enough to read and remember that definition.

Any hypermedia format which lets documents define their own elements is an infinite universe of "fetch"-es that it needs to make happen. We renounce the schematamania that plagues many hypermedia discussions. Instead, when we talk about semantics, we talk about the simple act of using elements in accordance with their specified meaning.

Instead of being extensible through schemasi or namespaces, or whatever DTDs are, HTML is extended in two ways:

 - Ad-hoc extensibility. HTML is a fault-tolerant language, choosing to ignore things it doesn't recognize instead of throwing errors. This means you can use unspecified attributes. htmx relies on this heavily. If extensions see common acceptance, they might even be incorporated into specifications! (We can dream.)
 - Extension slots. Things like classes, `<meta>` tags and `data-` attributes are made for custom data. They can be used to build meta-languages embedded in HTML.

This might seem like a downgrade, and an anxiety-inducing one at that. Think of the name collisions! While it has some significant drawbacks, it also correctly acknowledges that defining custom semantics without prior agreement between all parties is a fiction. A flexible format --- not an infinity of namespaces with URLs pointing to nothing --- is how you do "software design on the scale of decades".

Let's be real, after all --- out of all the sites using "Open Graph" tags, how many use the appropriate `prefix` attribute? How many of their developers even know the `prefix` attribute exists?


## Writing quality HTML

// TODO introduce the chapter


### HTML is for humans first

People who write HTML are referred to in Web platform specifications as "authors".
This sells our lot short by quite a lot, however;
from day to day, the average web developer might take on the role of
typesetter, copy editor, graphic designer, and of course, programmer.

... [TODO]

This is also important for non-visual usage.
Don't orient yourself solely towards following ARIA specifications or herding screen readers.
Those are the means, but usability is the goal.


### You don't need to guess what tags mean

"The beginning of wisdom is to call things by their right names."
-- Confucius

If you have ever made the mistake of publishing code online,
you might have had someone send you links to the HTML specification.
It was probably some section of chapter 4, "The elements of HTML".
(You might even have received it from this author).

While the big spec document with all the algorithms is probably better for smugly correcting people in chatrooms,
there is actually a developer-friendly version at https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev/.
For a sufficiently patient reader, it's practically a textbook.

For a less patient reader, section 4 features a list of all tags in HTML.
It includes what tags mean, where they can occur, and what they are allowed to contain.
It even tells you when you're allowed to leave out closing tags!

<!doctype html>
This is a valid HTML document.

### Revisit the "HTML5 elements"

A set of elements introduced with HTML5 have become a sort of shorthand symbol for semantic markup:

 - section
 - article
 - nav
 - header
 - footer
 - TODO were there more

You can find websites that were clearly built with the mindset: "The more of these elements there are, the more semantic it is." An example from the wonderful https://www.htmhell.dev/[HTMHell]:

.HTMHell, [.cite]##10 <section> is no replacement for <div>#, https://www.htmhell.dev/10-section-is-no-replacement-for-div/
[source,html]
----
<section id="page-top">
  <section data-section-id="page-top" style="display: none;"></section>
</section>
<main>
  <section id="main-content">
    <header id="main-header">
      <h1>...</h1>
      <section class="container-fluid">
        <section class="row">
          <article class="content col-sm-12">
            <section class="content-inner">
              <div class="content__body">
                <article class="slider">
                  <section class="slide"> â€¦ </section>
                </article>
              </div>
            </section>
          </article>
        </section>
      </section>
    </header>
  </section>
</main>

### Hide stuff the right way

`hidden` attributex
- fully hidden from everyone
- might need to be normalized with CSS

`display: none` makes stuff disappear

"Visually hidden" utility
- seen by AT

### Label your inputs, one way or another

`<input>` elements always need to be labelled. However, they don't necessarily need a visible `<label>` element. There are other ways to label:

// asciidoc why can't you be normal

- *Use a label, but hide it visually with CSS:* Use the visually hidden utility for this.

- *Use `aria-label`:*

<form>
  <input type="search" aria-label="Search for...">

- **Use `aria-labelledby`:**
This can be a good option for inputs where a nearby element provides context.

### Don't use <figcaption> for alt-text

Use the `alt` attribute instead! Figure captions shouldn't regurgitate the information in an image. Instead, they should be used to give context or provide metadata such as source or date. The `alt` attribute, on the other hand, should be a substitute for the image, describing the relevant aspects of what is depicted for the benefit of people who can't view it.

Captions might be misused for alt text when the author wants the alt text to be visible as text. To achieve this, some social media platforms use an "ALT" button that opens the alt text in a popup window. The main drawback of this approach is that you need to implement a popup window. You could instead use a `<p>` after the image with `aria-hidden` on it.

.The `alt` attribute
****
They say a picture is worth a thousand words. How am I supposed to produce an acceptable substitute in just a few sentences?

When writing alt text, you should only provide the information that is relevant. This means that the alt text should not be stored with the image (as is unfortunately the case with many CMSs) but in the document --- because different aspects of an image are relevant in different contexts.

TODO link resources on alt text.
****


### Write useful link text

Wherever possible, the text of a link should describe what the link points to without much context needed. Of course, you might need to alter it to fit a sentence structure, but you should avoid links that don't give information other than "this is a link".
