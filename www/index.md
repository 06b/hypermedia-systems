# Building Hypermedia Systems

This is a book about building systems with hypermedia, or, as we like to call them, Hypermedia Driven Applications (HDAs).

It covers:

* What Hypermedia Is
* Using htmx to build web-based HDAs
* Using HyperView to build mobile HDAs
* Using non-Hypermedia technology effectively within HDAs
